</div>

<p>A couple of my goals for this year are to learn both Javascript and D3.js. Its
gotten to the point where its embarrassing that I don't know Javascript, and
I want to learn D3 since I keep on seeing so many beautiful looking
visualizations being made with it. To get started with this, I thought I'd try use D3 to create the simplest possible visualization I could think of - the Venn diagram.</p>

<p>An example of this code in action is below. You can set the sizes of each set, and the
sizes of the set intersections - and the code will dynamically compute the best position
for each set, and display it with D3:</p>

<script>

function getSetIntersections() {
    areas = d3.selectAll(".venn_area")[0].map(
        function (element) { 
            return { sets: element.id.split(","), 
                     size: parseFloat(element.value)};} );
    return areas;
}


// draw the initial set
var w = Math.min(480, document.documentElement.clientWidth-30);
var chart = venn.VennDiagram()
                 .width(w)
                 .height(w * .8);

d3.select("#dynamic").datum(getSetIntersections()).call(chart);

// redraw the sets on any change in input
d3.selectAll("input").on("change", function() {
    d3.select("#dynamic").datum(getSetIntersections()).call(chart);
});

</script>


<p>The hard part here isn't actually displaying the diagram with D3  -
its calculating the positions of each set such that the areas of each region are
proportional to the size of the set intersections.</p>

<p>The problem is that even for only 3 sets, its not always possible to position
everything so that everything is area proportional to the set sizes. Try
changing A=B=C=8 , AB=AC=4 and BC=0 in the above
example to see what I mean about impossible layouts. There is no way to
exactly satisfy all those constraints. Even worse is trying to layout Euler
diagrams with 4+ sets: if there are no disjoint sets, its actually impossible to use
circles to represent these set relations exactly.</p>

<p>I still want the best possible approximation even if its not possible to be
perfect all the time.  So I did the
sensible thing here: define a function that measures how well a layout
matches the desired overlaps - and then minimize that function numerically.</p>

<h3>Searching for a solution</h3>

<p>The loss function I'm using is just an sum of squared errors,
comparing the actual size of each overlapping set to the desired size.</p>

<blockquote><p>lossFunction = ∑ (actualOverlap<sub>i</sub> - desiredOverlap<sub>i</sub> )<sup>2</sup>
)</p></blockquote>

<p>To minimize this function, I started out using the <a href="http://www.numericjs.com/">unconstrained minimization
function from numeric.js</a> - but ran into
some issues with it. This was probably aggravated by occasionally using a discrete
approximation to the loss function (more on that in a bit), and by numeric.js attempting to approximate the
gradient using a really small step size. So I switched to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelder%E2%80%93Mead_method">downhill
simplex method</a>,
writing it out myself since I didn't see a Javascript version available.</p>

<h4>Finding Initial Positions</h4>

<div class="well">
<b> Update Jun. 2015</b>: This has been updated with a different algorithm for computing initial positions. While the greedy layout is still used, this new algorithm fixes some issues that it occasionally encountered. <a href="/better-venn-diagrams/">More details here</a>
</div>


<p>Using a local optimization technique requires a good initial layout to
optimize. Positioning the sets randomly works kind of poorly
for large numbers of sets, and I prefer a deterministic solution anyways.</p>

<p>My solution was to use a simple greedy approach. Each set is laid out one at a time,
from sets with the biggest intersections to sets with the smallest. For each
set that is being added, the distance to each laid out set is computed such
that the overlap area is proportional to the size of the set intersection. The distances are used to generate a list of
points to evaluate, and the set is added at the point where the loss function
is lowest. The points to evaluate are just 90 degrees to each single set, and
the two points where the distances are exactly correct relative to each pair of sets (if possible).</p>

<h4>Calculating overlap area for 3+ circles</h4>

<div class="well">
<b> Update Nov. 2013 </b>: This library now has a fast exact method of
calculating 3+ circle overlaps - making this section somewhat obsolete.
<a href="/calculating-the-intersection-of-3-or-more-circles/">More details here</a>
</div>


<p>This only really leaves calculating the loss function.</p>

<p>Coming up with the formula for the overlap area of two circles was relatively
easy - it just required remembering enough calculus to set up the equation,
and then getting Wolfram Alpha to do the actual integration for me.</p>

<p>However, I couldn't find a way to scale this up to handle 3+ circles. Quite
honestly my rusting calculus skills are just not up to the job here.  So I did the logical thing and googled for research on how to compute this.</p>

<div style="float:right;text-align:center;">
<small>These seem to be my choices here:</small>
<div class="notfunny"></div>
</div>


<script>
var w2 = Math.min(350, document.documentElement.clientWidth-35), h2 = w2/ 2.;
var notfunny = [{sets: ["fast"], size: 30}, 
                 {sets: ["exact"], size: 30},
                 {sets: ["uses 3+ overlaps"], size: 30},
                 {size : 7, sets : ['fast','exact']},
                 {size : 0, sets : ['fast','uses 3+ overlaps']},
                 {size : 0, sets : ['exact','uses 3+ overlaps']}];

var vd = venn.VennDiagram().width(w2).height(h2);
d3.select(".notfunny").datum(notfunny).call(vd);;
</script>


<p>I found an <a href="http://www.cs.uic.edu/~wilkinson/Publications/venneuler.pdf">interesting paper on laying out area proportional venn and euler
diagrams</a> by
Leland Wilkinson.  Since computing circle overlaps is apparently uber
difficult, he talks about how to approximate this. His approach is to actually
plot each set and use binary indexing to figure out the overlap areas.</p>

<p>The idea here is to actually draw each set out, and set the colour for the set
such that only one unique bit is set. For example in the 3
set case the colours for each set would
be (001, 010, 100) in binary. By drawing out each circle with that colour, and summing
the colours in case of overlaps - you can get a diagram where each possible
region is represented by a unique colour. Getting the size of all the regions
is as simple as calculating a colour histogram on the drawn out image.</p>

<p>Implementing this in Javascript means using Canvas operations, since
that seems to be the only way to directly manipulate images and get the pixel
values. On a 200x200 canvas, calculating the loss like this
takes about 6ms on my laptop. Which sounds good, until you realize that we
need to calculate the loss hundreds of times during the optimization step.</p>

<p>For offline processing, this wouldn't be a huge deal - but a second
processing delay is way too slow for interactive use. Even worse, is that my
browser seems to totally lock up while this is going on.</p>

<p>Also the output between using 3+ overlaps and not usually isn't all that
different. Getting the overlaps of 2 sets right, usually means that the
overlaps of 3 or more sets are basically right - or the problem is so over-constrained
that its impossible to get right. I ripped off an example of this from the
Wilkinson paper to demonstrate what I mean here:</p>

<script>
var medicalSets = [{label : 'SE', size : 28, sets:[0],}, 
                   {label : 'Treat', size: 35, sets:[1],},
                   {label : 'Anti-CCP', size : 108, sets:[2],}, 
                   {label : 'DAS28', size:106, sets:[3],},
                   {sets : [0,1], size:1},
                   {sets : [0,2], size:1},
                   {sets : [0,3], size:14},
                   {sets : [1,2], size:6},
                   {sets : [1,3], size:0},
                   {sets : [2,3], size:1},
                   {sets : [0,2,3], size:1}
                       ];

d3.select(".medical").datum(medicalSets).call(venn.VennDiagram().width(350).height(250));
</script>


<p>While they look somewhat different, if you rotate one of them and take the
mirror image - they are in fact almost identical. The only real difference is
in the intersection of the 'Anti-CCP &amp; DAS28 &amp; SE' set overlaps - where its
marginally bigger in the Wilkinson version. While the Wilkinson version is
more accurate, the size of this 3 way intersection is supposed to be the same
as the intersection of 'Treat &amp; SE', so both versions are wrong here - because
its impossible to lay this out perfectly.</p>

<p>Since its so slow, and doesn't seem to have a huge benefit - I disabled this method of
calculating the loss function by default. Instead I just calculate the loss on only the
intersection of 2 sets, and ignore the higher order effects. If its going to
be an approximation anyways, I'd much rather have a fast approximation.</p>

<p>The Wilkinson paper is an interesting read if you're into that kind of thing.
While our approaches are vaguely similar, his initial
layout and optimization method are quite different from the approach I took.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>The venn diagrams above don't really test out how well this performs on more
complicated layouts.  So I took
some datasets I happened to have on my computer, and ran some of them through
here.</p>

<div id="lastfm"></div>


<h4>Last.fm Music Data</h4>

<p>Lets try visualizing if <a href="http://www.thingsontop.com/roads-lead-radiohead-431.html">all roads really do lead to Radiohead
</a>. Each artist is
represented by the set of users that played them, with the data being grabbed
from a <a href="http://www.dtic.upf.edu/~ocelma/MusicRecommendationDataset/lastfm-360K.html">dataset of 360k last.fm
users</a>.</p>

<p>The goal here is
to visualize the pernicious effect of popularity on collaborative filtering based
recommender systems. Most of the artists here have more users in common with
Radiohead than any other band, despite coming from different genres and eras
of music. This effect totally dominates this graph, with Radiohead being at the centre and all other artists clustering around them.</p>

<div class="lastfm"></div>


<h4>Netflix</h4>

<p>As a final example, lets see if we can get anything interesting out of the
<a href="http://www.netflixprize.com/">Netflix Prize dataset</a>. I picked 6 movies, kind of at random - and then
represented them using the set of users that gave the movie a 5 star rating.
While its not all that interesting, I still like it because the movies here
are sort of arranged by quality, with worse movies being farther right:</p>

<div class="netflix"></div>


<h3>Wrapping this all up</h3>

<p>I've put the code on github <a href="http://github.com/benfred/venn.js">here</a> for anyone
that wants to play around with it. Since its the first time I've written more
than 10 lines of Javascript code, its probably mostly awful - but someone may
still find it useful.</p>

<p>While this code works reasonably well, there are a couple of areas that I
think could use some improvement. The greedy layout I'm using sometimes picks
up a local minima that the optimizer can't step out of. This is somewhat
visible in the lastfm example, where the total loss could be
reduced if John Lennon was inserted in between Elvis and Morrisey (as well as
Philip Glass near Bach). I have some ideas on fixing this, but since this is really getting away from my goals here of learning Javascript and D3 I thought I'd release this as is.</p>

<p>In the end, this wasn't a great project to learn D3 on - since the D3 part of it was so
easy. The only tricky part in using D3 was getting the labels centred in
the circles, and that really wasn't that hard. It was a decent first project in Javascript though. I got along pretty well
here once I started treating Javascript as being Python code with a C++
syntax, and just googling for the rare cases where that didn't just work. I
got a little hung up on some of Javascripts limitations (dictionaries
can only be keyed by strings etc) but its not a completely horrible language
to work with.</p>
